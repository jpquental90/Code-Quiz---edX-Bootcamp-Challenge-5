# Code Quiz

This repository contains my answer to the Module 6 Challenge of the Web Development edX bootcamp: https://jpquental90.github.io/Password-Generator---edX-Bootcamp-Challenge-5/

## Description

My task was to create a time quiz application that uses local storage to store highscores. Some starter code was provided by edX in HTML and CSS files. A gif demonstrating the desired local of the final product was provided as a guide.

After clicking 'Submit', the Highscores page is displayed. This page is also accessible at all times from the top left corner of the quiz pages. 

#### Highscores display, with submissions listed by order of score (first priority) and time left (second priority):

## Code

I have made some changes to the HTML and especially the CSS file, but the main work was completed on JavaScript. I created all 3 JavaScript files suggested as links (in the index.html and highscores.html files) in the starter code. Comments were added throughout to explain each of the steps taken to create the app functionality and interaction with the user.

#### Questions file

## Credits

I have studied DOM manipulation on Digital Ocean and Google was used to research the solution for each coding step. I have used the edX bootcamp Xpert Learning Assistant to help troubleshoot some of the problems with the code. I also consulted some of the material from the edX bootcamp classes.
